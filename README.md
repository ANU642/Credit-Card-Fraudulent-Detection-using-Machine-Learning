# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using **anomaly detection algorithms** such as:
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- One-Class SVM

It uses the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
